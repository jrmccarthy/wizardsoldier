0.2 - 04/28/12
Changes
- With the addition of MOAIRenderMgr, the system no longer adds its layer automatically to
  MOAI's rendering queue. This should solve the problem with scene managers
- More consistent function naming and parameters
- Added texture, font, and text style managers
- Using MOAIProp's attribute linking to maintain position information
- Removed the use of module(..., package.seeall)
- Using MOAITextStyles for text instead of just MOAIFont

Bugfixes
- Window widgets were not being created correctly by factory.lua
- Textbox - fixed a problem where the last "word" would not be displayed if it was only one character

0.201 - 05/08/12
Bugfixes
- Changed gui's _calcInputOver function to use MOAIPartition:propListForPoint instead of
  MOAIPartition:propForPoint. This will prevent windows that are hidden from accepting input
